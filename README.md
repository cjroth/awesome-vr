## Design Considerations

- Don’t begin until the user indicates readiness
- Mismatch between bodily cues and visual cues cause simulator sickness
- User should tap button with VR icon to enter a scene
- Do not use dialogues; they do not work with binocular vision
- Indicate that an app includes VR by mentioning VR in the title and including screenshots of binocular vision
- Use full screen mode, not lights out mode
- Users can target/select objects in their field of vision; when doing so, display a reticle (plus sign with circle around it) to show the user what they are “selecting"
- Don’t use text instructions; use audio
- Using haptic (sense of touch) information for feedback is good
- Put UI controls directly in user’s field of vision
- Use “fuse buttons” to let the user select things but also allow the user to click the button on their goggles so they don’t have to wait for the button to activate. A fuse button is a button that the user can “click” by targeting their glasses at a point and holding it for a few seconds to activate it.
- Show a countdown to activation for fuse buttons
- Don’t put fuse buttons too close together
- Avoid sudden transitions between dark and light brightness
- Use fixed objects to ground a user - eg putting them in a cockpit, virtual chair, etc. If they are sitting IRL then show them sitting in the VR.
- Users should be active controllers in the app, not passengers
- Try to always keep head tracking on in the app; if needed, show splash screens or 2D images in 3D space
- Avoid creating sudden cuts to another scene if producing cinematics
- Using spatial audio for attracting user attention is highly effective
- Placing objects in scene closer than a perceived 6 inches from user's face will make them uncomfortable
- Average human has a binocular field of view of ~114 degrees (about 1/3 of a circle)
